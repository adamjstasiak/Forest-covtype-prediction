# Covtype forest prediction

## Repository contains predicions for forest covtype in covtype databese.

## There are used four different solutions to solve this problem:

### 1. Own heuristics based on database documentanion in covtypeinfo file.

### 2. Decison tree machine learnig model from scikit-learn library,

### 3. Random forest mchine learnig model from scikit-learn library,

### 4. Neural network with hyperparameters tune from tensorflow.

## Model and function file contains funtio to generate models and load data.

## Main file evaluate all models and compere them by accuracy store, confusions matrixes and classification reports and plotting train curves for neural network. All used plots are saved.
